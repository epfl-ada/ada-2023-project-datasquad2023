**Abstract:** 

In the past few years, more and more people joined YouTube as content creators. Some of them managed to create a successful channel and others less so. We are interested in understanding why this happened (i.e. the reasons that “potentially” explain and led to the success of some channels over others). Based on an insightful data analysis conducted on the Youniverse dataset, we aim to formulate a guide, targeting new YouTubers/old YouTubers who would like to improve their channel in order to become more successful. Due to the large size of the dataset, we decided to focus on tech review channels.
