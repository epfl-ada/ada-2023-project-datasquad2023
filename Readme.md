**Abstract:** 

In the past few years, more and more people joined YouTube as content creators. Some of them managed to create a successful channel and others less so. We are interested in understanding why this happened (i.e. the reasons that 
“potentially” led to the success of some channels over others) and in formulating a guide, targeting new YouTubers/old YouTubers that would like to improve their channel and becoming more successful based on an insightful data analysis conducted 
on the Youniverse dataset. Due to the large size of the dataset, we decided to focus on tech review channels.
