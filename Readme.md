**Abstract:** 

In the past few years, more and more people joined YouTube as content creators. Some of them managed to create a successful channel and others less so. We are interested in understanding why this happened (i.e. the reasons that “potentially” explain and led to the success of some channels over others). Based on an insightful data analysis conducted on the Youniverse dataset, we aim to formulate a guide, targeting new YouTubers/old YouTubers who would like to improve their channel in order to become more successful. Due to the large size of the dataset, we decided to focus on tech review channels.


**Methods**

Salma :  Identify the channels that talk about a release event to analyse their evolution in terms of the number of subscribers compared to those which do not talk about the event. First, we focus on 1 event. Then, we will generalize to the 5 others. From the title and tags of the videos, we classify them according to the presence of the "item" in this metadata - treat (if talks about the relelase - control if not). We focus on videos that have an upload date from the release till one month after.
Then, we classify the channels considering that if a channel has at least one video that talk about the release, it is treat channel. 
We compare the growth of channels (measured with the number of views) for treat and control channels to see if channels that talks about a release have a higher growth than he ones which do not. To do this comparaison, we use the time series data and focus on a period that goes from one month before the release till one month after.
Then, we do an observational study (causal analysis) with the outcome being the number of subscribers while identifying the counfounders.
We first, focus on 1 event "iphone x"

**Organization within the team**

Continue with question 3a, generalize to the to the other events and do the causal analysis. Do 3b : from now till 1st December
Writing the report/data story + website (presentation of data story ): from 1st Decembre till 22 Decembre
